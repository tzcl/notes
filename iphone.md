# Setting up a new iPhone

I just got a new iPhone 15 Pro after having an iPhone 11 for the last few years.
The first things I did after setting up my iCloud account were:

1. Install Bitwarden so I can log into all my accounts
  - Go into System Settings and set it up so AutoFill uses this instead of iCloud keychain. 
  - Make Bitwarden use FaceID to authenticate to avoid constantly retyping master password.
2. Download Google Maps/Calendar/Photos
  - Google Maps is perhaps the best feature of smartphones. It's so helpful trying to navigate a new city.
  - I prefer Google Calendar and Photos over the Apple equivalents as they're cross-platform and seem to have less sync issues.
3. Set up Messenger/Instagram to be able to message people
4. Transfer across Google Authenticator to ensure I can still access accounts that rely on it.
  - I'm still sad about my Battle.net account that I can't log into anymore because I don't have access to the phone I originally set up the authenticator on.
5. Download Safari extension, including an adblocker
  - This makes a massive difference in quality of life while surfing the web.

After doing all of this, 80-90% of the usecases I have for my phone are covered. 
There are definitely more apps that I use, but I can install them as needed.
