# Notes
My personal notes, loosely based on [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and [Josh Braunchaud's TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/).

Principles:
- Notes should be atomic, containing one idea or concept.
- Every note should consist of:
  - A title or a 'concept handle' (after Scott Alexander)
    - Prefer precise, declarative titles
  - A unit of knowledge
    - What makes something one note versus multiple is a personal choice and depends on how you plan to use that information.
    - The body of the note should be written in my own words, not copy-pasted or lifted from another source.
- Higher-order notes should link atomic notes together, building a tree of knowledge.
