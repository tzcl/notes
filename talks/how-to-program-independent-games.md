# How to program independent games

## Notes

Structure:
- Talking about lines of code
  - Interesting point about the size of writing a games like Braid
    (90k LOC, took about 3 years to build)
- Optimising for speed, space, and for your limited time
- Data structures are all about optimisation
- Algorithms are also about optimising operations

- Be extremely effective at getting things done
- *Impulses to optimise are usually premature*
- Most code is **not** performance-sensitive
- Data structures are fundamentally about optimising how your program interacts with data

Why?

Most of the time, the implementation does not matter. If it really does matter,
you can always come back and make it better.

The most important part of the video:

Optimise for time to project completion! In other words, one of the most 
important factors to optimise for is actually shipping code. It's easy to forget
about this or procrastinate by spending time writing and rewriting parts of your
project. The key to making a successful indie game is to *get things done*.

It's the same as Go's philosophy of letting abstractions emerge rather than
trying to guess them ahead of time. It also reminds of making code easy to delete.

Fundamentally, the discussion is around the fact that optimisations take up time
to implement and can be harder to maintain. When you have the lens of getting
stuff done, the trade-offs made by sophisticated data structures and algorithms
becomes less worthwhile.

What's a good programmer?
- Gets things done quickly
- Gets things done robustly
- Makes things simple
- Finishes what they start
- Broad knowledge of advanced ideas and techniques
  (but only uses them when genuinely helpful)

There's a difference between "knowing" and deeply, intuitively understanding.

Story about Jon flaming Doom developer on the Doom mailing list. This is a great
story.

## Q&A

Anything important here? I don't think there was.
